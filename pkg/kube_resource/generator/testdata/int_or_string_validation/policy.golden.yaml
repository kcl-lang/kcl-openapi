                  from (or terminates at) endpoints within the selected
                  namespaces will be matched. When both NamespaceSelector
                  and another selector are defined on the same rule, then

                  will be selected by the rule. \n For NetworkPolicy, an

                  a selector expression (see Policy for sample syntax).
                  \ Only traffic that originates from (terminates at) endpoints
                  matching the selector will be matched. \n Note that: in
                  addition to the negated version of the Selector (see NotSelector
                  below), the selector expression syntax itself supports
                  negation.  The two types of negation are subtly different.
                  One negates the set of matched endpoints, the other negates
                  the whole match: \n \tSelector = \"!has(my_label)\" matches
                  packets that are from other Calico-controlled \tendpoints
                  that do not have the label \"my_label\". \n \tNotSelector
                  = \"has(my_label)\" matches packets that are not from
                  Calico-controlled \tendpoints that do have the label \"my_label\".
                  \n The effect is that the latter will accept packets from
                  non-Calico sources whereas the former is limited to packets
                  from Calico-controlled endpoints."
