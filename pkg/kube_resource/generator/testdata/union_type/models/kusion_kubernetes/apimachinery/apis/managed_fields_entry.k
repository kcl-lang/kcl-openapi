schema ManagedFieldsEntry:
    """ ManagedFieldsEntry is a workflow-id, a FieldSet and the group version of the resource that the fieldset applies to.

    Attributes
    ----------
    apiVersion : str, default is Undefined, optional
         APIVersion defines the version of this resource that this field set applies to. The format is "group/version" just like the top-level APIVersion field. It is necessary to track the version of a field set because it cannot be automatically converted.
    fieldsType : str, default is Undefined, optional
         FieldsType is the discriminator for the different fields format and version. There is currently only one possible value: "FieldsV1"
    fieldsV1 : any, default is Undefined, optional
         FieldsV1 holds the first JSON version format as described in the "FieldsV1" type.
    manager : str, default is Undefined, optional
         Manager is an identifier of the workflow managing these fields.
    operation : str, default is Undefined, optional
         Operation is the type of operation which lead to this ManagedFieldsEntry being created. The only valid values for this field are 'Apply' and 'Update'.
    time : str, default is Undefined, optional
         Time is timestamp of when these fields were set. It should always be empty if Operation is 'Apply'
